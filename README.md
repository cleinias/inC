# inC
Self-education project -- replicate Terry Riley's _In C_ with Supercollider (and learn SC's pattern language along the way)

The replica is divided into a number of stages of increasing complexity. Each stage, if it exists,
is fully contained with a Supercollider file named _inC-n.scd_ with n from 1 to 7. Follow the instructions within the file to create and execute a performance of inC at the _n_ level. 

See docs/Description.md for details.
