##  In C

### Project description
A SuperCollider rendition of Terry Riley's In C that follows Riley's score instructions as closely as possible

This is a self-education project aimed at improving my familiarity with classic minimalism
and with SueprCollider (and especially its pattern language).

A few iterations are planned. Phase 1 is a minimal working example, successive phases add more complexity.

### Basic elements of Riley's score, as per his own instructions:

1.  53 melodic patterns
2.  Patterns are to be played consecutively with each
    performer having the freedom to determine how many times
    he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next.
3.  To keep the performance between 45 min and an hour eache pattern
    should be repeated between 45 seconds and a minute and a half (45''-90'')
    or longer.
4.  A group of about 35 instrumentalists is desired but smaller
    or larger groups can work too.
5.  Any instrument can play.
6.  Each pattern can be played in unison or canonically
    in any alignment with itself or with its neighboring patterns.
7.  As the performance progresses, performers should stay
    within 2 or 3 patterns of each other. It is important not
    to race too far ahead or to lag too far behind.
8.  The ensemble can be aided by the means of an eighth note pulse
    played on the high C’s of the piano or on a mallet instrument.
9.  It is also possible to use improvised percussion in strict rhythm
    (drum set, cymbals, bells, etc.), if it is carefully done
    and  doesn’t overpower the ensemble.
10. Tempo is left to the discretion of the performers, not too slow.
11. It is OK to transpose patterns by an octave, especially to transpose up.
12. Transposing down by octaves works best on the patterns
    containing notes of long durations.
13. Augmentation of rhythmic values can also be effective.
14. In C is ended in this way: when each performer arrives at figure #53,
    he or she stays on it until the entire ensemble has arrived there.
15. The group then makes a large crescendo and diminuendo a few times
    and each player drops out as he or she wishes.
