/*   In C

A supercollider rendition of Terry Riley's In C that follows Riley's score instructions as closely as possible
*/

/* Basic elements of Riley's score, as per his own instructions:

1.  53 melodic patterns
2.  Patterns are to be played consecutively with each
    performer having the freedom to determine how many times
    he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on to the next.
3.  To keep the performance between 45 min and an hour eache pattern
    should be repeated between 45 seconds and a minute and a half or longer
4.  A group of about 35 instrumentalist is desired but smaller
    or larger groups can work too.
5.  Any instrument can play
6.  Each pattern can be played in unison or canonically
    in any alignment with itself or with its neighboring patterns.
7.  As the performance progresses, performers should stay
    within 2 or 3 patterns of each other. It is important not
    to race too far ahead or to lag too far behind.
8.  The ensemble can be aided by the means of an eighth note pulse
    played on the high c’s of the piano or on a mallet instrument.
9.  It is also possible to use improvised percussion in strict rhythm
    (drum set, cymbals, bells, etc.), if it is carefully done
    and  doesn’t overpower the ensemble.
10. Tempo is left to the discretion of the performers, not too slow
11. It is OK to transpose patterns by an octave, especially to transpose up.
12. Transposing down by octaves works best on the patterns
    containing notes of long durations.
13. Augmentation of rhythmic values can also be effective.
14. IN C is ended in this way: when each performer arrives at figure #53,
    he or she stays on it until the entire ensemble has arrived there.
15. The group then makes a large crescendo and diminuendo a few times
    and each player drops out as he or she wishes.

/*

- Each player must have, at a minimum, a version of the score and an instrument to play it on.
  Other parameters may be added later.
- There are at least two possible options for player creation (looking forward to full implementation):
   a - Create every player individually, and customize them one by one
   b - Instantiate a random number of players into a vector, then customize them

 - There are also at least two possible options for score creation:
   a - create each player's complete score before executing the performance
   b - have each player instantiate the needed number of repetitions for each melodic cell
       *during* the performance (simulating an actual performance as originally intended)
   Option b is more interesting and leave open the possibility of inserting (later)
   some interaction with the performance suring execution, but it is also more complex.

I will start with the simpler (a) options first.
